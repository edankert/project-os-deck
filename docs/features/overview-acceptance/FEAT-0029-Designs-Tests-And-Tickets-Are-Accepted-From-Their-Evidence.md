# Designs, acceptance tests and tickets are accepted from a picture of their evidence

## Goal

**A person gives the three project-os verdicts in Deck, each from a picture of the evidence.** These are S5, S6 and S7 in [[DES-0005-The-Overview-Is-Drawn-Not-Written]]: accept a design from its plates, run an acceptance test as beads on a ring with before-and-after images, and accept a feature at a gate of lamps. Every write goes through the cockpit's sidecar and its guards; Deck adds no write path, and an agent's verdict is refused.

Lane: `system:codex`. How the two agents share this phase is in [[REFERENCE-OVERVIEW-GOAL-TWO-AGENT-BRIEF]].

## Scope

- S5 Design acceptance: plates, revision strip, review pins; Accept and Decline through `/api/notes/decide`.
- S6 Acceptance test: platform rings from `/api/cockpit/release-test`, check beads, before-and-after captures; results through `/api/notes/mark-check`, with a reason for every result but Pass.
- S7 Ticket acceptance: the five-lamp gate from `/api/cockpit/acceptance`, `/api/cockpit/obligations` and Deck's index; Accept and Send back through `/api/notes/transition` and `/api/notes/acceptance-run`.
- A gate component small enough for S3 to show (FEAT-0028).
- Rows in [[REFERENCE-COCKPIT-ADOPTION]] moved to adopted for exactly what these screens use, and a risk note if a payload Deck now depends on can change under it.

Out of scope:

- Any verdict written by an agent, by any route.
- Release preparation, sealing and marking released; those stay in the cockpit.

## Acceptance

- Edwin accepts a design in S5, records a Pass and a Fail in S6, and accepts a feature in S7; each verdict shows in the cockpit afterwards.
- The same three verbs from an agent session are refused by the sidecar, and Deck shows the refusal.
- S7 offers Accept only when every lamp is lit, and each unlit lamp names what is missing on hover.
- Each screen passes FEAT-0026's screen checks; S6 is checked on your-trainer's REL-0017 and on Deck with no release.

## Verification

Node suites for the reads, the gate logic and the refusal of agent verdicts; window-opening runs batched once with Edwin's permission; one acceptance test per flow, run by Edwin on your-trainer and on Deck. Nothing has been run yet.

## Where this stands

2026-10-14: defined, not started. PHASE-0005 is `active` since 2026-10-14, so the lane can start. The owner creates the task notes from [the plan](plan/PLAN.md) before writing code, taking each id as the brief says.

## Questions between the lanes

None yet. Write a question here, dated, and land it on `main`; the other agent answers under it.
